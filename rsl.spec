%description
This library is an object oriented programming environment for writing software
applicable to all RADAR data related to the TRMM GV effort. This library reads
the WSR88D, Lassen, Sigmet, McGill, UF, HDF, RAPIC, RADTEC and native RSL file
formats. Additional functions are provided to manipulate the RSL objects.
Nearly all of the functions return objects. When they don't, they usually
perform actions like output, making images, etc. The most general object in RSL
is Radar. The structure Radar is the method used to define the ideal
or universal radar representation in RAM while keeping the natural resolution
of the data unchanged. More simply, Radar represents the super set of all radar
file formats. The Radar structure is hierarchically defined such that it is
composed of Volumes, each containing one field type. Volumes are composed
of Sweeps. Sweeps are composed of Rays and Rays contains a vector of the field
type. Some field types are Reflectivity(DZ), Velocity(VR), Spectrum Width(SW),
etc. There are approximately 20 field types.
